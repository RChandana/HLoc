# Hierarchical Localization


HLoc is a tool for Visual localization.
In this project, we will be dealing with HLoc, which will estimate the position/location of the camera/person who is holding the device within the surrounding large environment.

The main motive behind HLoc is to estimate the most accurate pose or location of the device or camera sensor based on the number of input images taken by the device itself.
