# Hierarchical Localization


HLoc is a tool used for Visual Localization.

In this project, we will be dealing with HLoc, which is designed to estimate the position/location of the camera/person who is holding the device within the surrounding large environment.

The main motive behind HLoc is to estimate the most accurate pose or location of the device or camera sensor based on the number of input images taken by the device.

HLoc can reconstruct a 3D model using features of a set of input images. After that it can localize a given query image into the 3D model by estimating a 6 Degree-of-Freedom pose.
